## Abstract

In the expansive domain of autonomous driving, where vehicles often operate in isolation from human intervention, our innovation strives to reintroduce human interaction â€“ but from a perspective not previously explored. Instead of being limited within the cabin, we imagine a world where drivers can step out and control their vehicles from the outside. This proposal is advantageous for narrow parking situations or navigating congested areas.
